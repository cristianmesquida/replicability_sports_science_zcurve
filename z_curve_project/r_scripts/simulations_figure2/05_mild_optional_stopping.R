## This R script was used to:
## 1) simulate p-values when researchers engage in mild optional stopping
## 2) conduct the corresponding zcurve analysis


# Load package
library(zcurve) 

# For reproducibility purposes
set.seed(1234) 


## 1) Simulate mild optional stopping

# Set parameters to run simulation
N <- 50 # total data points (per condition)
looks <- 5 # set number of looks at the data
nsims <- 300 # number of simulated studies
alphalevel <- 0.05 # set alpha level


if(looks > 1){
  look_at_n <- ceiling(seq(N / looks, N, (N - (N / looks)) / (looks - 1)))
}  else {
  look_at_n <- N
}
look_at_n <- look_at_n[look_at_n > 2] # Remove looks at N of 1 or 2
looks<-length(look_at_n) # if looks are removed, update number of looks

matp <- matrix(NA, nrow = nsims, ncol = looks) # Matrix for p-values l tests
p <- numeric(nsims) # Variable to save pvalues

# Loop data generation for each study, then loop to perform a test for each N
for (i in 1:nsims) {
  x <- rnorm(n = N, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  y <- rnorm(n = N, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  for (j in 1:looks) {
    matp[i, j] <- t.test(x[1:look_at_n[j]], y[1:look_at_n[j]],
                         var.equal = TRUE, alternative = "greater")$p.value # perform the t-test, store
  }
  cat("Loop", i, "of", nsims, "\n")
}

# Save Type 1 error rate smallest p at all looks
for (i in 1:nsims) {
  p[i] <- ifelse(length(matp[i,which(matp[i,] < alphalevel)]) == 0,
                 matp[i,looks], matp[i,which(matp[i,] < alphalevel)])
}


## 2) zcurve analysis
zcurve_mild_optional_stopping <- zcurve(p = p)
summary(zcurve_mild_optional_stopping, all = TRUE)


# Number of significant p-values
power_function(p)
